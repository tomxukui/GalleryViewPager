Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```xml
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```
Add the dependency
```xml
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.RainbleNi:GalleryViewPager:2.0.0'
	}
```

##Usage
Is almost same as ViewPager from support.v4.
You should change the page width in PagerAdapter
```java
galleryViewPager.setAdapter(new PagerAdapter() {
     some same as support.v4.view.ViewPager
     .....
  @Override public float getPageWidth(int position) { 
    return 0.8f;//suggest value from 0.6 to 0.85
    }
}
```
If you need the side page is smaller than the center page, you should set the ratio of the side page to center page.
```java
galleryViewPager.setNarrowFactor(0.9f);//suggest value from 0.7 to 0.95
```
